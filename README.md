### What is Weav

Meet new people in a city, whether you're a tourist visiting or have recently moved, and you want to enjoy the company of others and go out, or you're looking to create a group of friends for activities, or you simply want to find someone with whom to share your interests such as painting or working out.

Weav empowers users to create moments, which are short text, images, or reposts with a duration ranging from 30 minutes to 1 day. These moments are visible to individuals in close proximity, allowing for widespread engagement among nearby people.

Additionally, users have the option to repost venues and events, asking new people to join. Everyone around you can reply to the moments, and it's up to you to decide whether to continue the conversation or not.

From the business perspective, this platform provides venue owners and event organisers with powerful tools to effectively promote their offerings. By becoming part of this network, they gain valuable visibility without any cost. 

The network fosters a culture of open sharing and lively discussions surrounding various venues and events, resulting in heightened visibility and a broader audience reach.
